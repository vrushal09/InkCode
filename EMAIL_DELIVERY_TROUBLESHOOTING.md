# Email Delivery Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issue: "EmailJS says mail sent but users didn't receive it"

This is a very common problem with EmailJS. Here's why it happens and how to fix it:

## Why Emails Aren't Delivered Even When EmailJS Says "Success"

1. **Spam/Junk Filters**: Most email providers automatically filter emails from unknown senders
2. **EmailJS Free Account Limitations**: Lower delivery rates and reliability
3. **Email Template Issues**: Missing or incorrect template variables
4. **Sender Reputation**: New EmailJS accounts have low sender reputation
5. **Email Provider Blocking**: Some providers block automated emails

## Immediate Solutions

### 1. Check Spam/Junk Folders
- **Gmail**: Check "Spam" folder
- **Outlook/Hotmail**: Check "Junk Email" folder
- **Yahoo**: Check "Spam" folder
- **Apple Mail**: Check "Junk" folder

### 2. Verify EmailJS Template
Your template should include these exact variable names:
- `{{to_email}}`
- `{{to_name}}`
- `{{from_name}}`
- `{{project_name}}`
- `{{invite_link}}`
- `{{role}}`
- `{{message}}`

### 3. Test Email Template
1. Go to your EmailJS dashboard
2. Click on your template
3. Use "Test Email" feature
4. Send a test to your own email first

### 4. Improve Email Content for Better Delivery

Here's an optimized email template that's less likely to be marked as spam:

```
Subject: [{{project_name}}] Collaboration Invitation from {{from_name}}

Hello {{to_name}},

{{from_name}} has invited you to collaborate on a project called "{{project_name}}" using InkCode.

ðŸŽ¯ Your Role: {{role}}

## Advanced Solutions

### 1. Upgrade EmailJS Account
- **Pro Plan Benefits**:
  - Higher delivery rates
  - Remove EmailJS branding
  - Better sender reputation
  - Priority support
  - More emails per month

### 2. Domain Authentication (Recommended)
1. Add your domain to EmailJS
2. Set up SPF and DKIM records
3. This significantly improves delivery rates

### 3. Use a Professional Email Service
For production applications, consider:
- **SendGrid**: Industry standard
- **AWS SES**: Amazon's email service
- **Mailgun**: Developer-friendly
- **Postmark**: High deliverability

### 4. Implement Email Verification
Add a confirmation step to verify emails are working:

```javascript
// Add this to your email service
export const sendTestEmail = async (email) => {
    try {
        const response = await emailjs.send(
            EMAIL_CONFIG.serviceId,
            'test_template_id', // Create a simple test template
            {
                to_email: email,
                message: 'This is a test email to verify delivery.'
            }
        );
        return { success: true, response };
    } catch (error) {
        return { success: false, error };
    }
};
```

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check EmailJS Dashboard
1. Log into EmailJS dashboard
2. Go to "History" or "Logs"
3. Check if emails are being processed
4. Look for any error messages

### 2. Monitor Browser Console
The updated code now logs detailed information:
```javascript
// Check browser console for these logs:
console.log('Sending email with params:', {...});
console.log('EmailJS response:', response);
console.log('Email sent to:', toEmail, 'Status:', response.status);
```

### 3. Test with Different Email Providers
Try sending invitations to:
- Gmail account
- Outlook account
- Yahoo account
- Your company email

### 4. Check Email Template Variables
Ensure your template uses the exact variable names as defined in the code.

## Production Recommendations

### 1. Implement Hybrid Approach
```javascript
// Always provide backup options
const sendInvitation = async (email, inviteLink) => {
    // Try email first
    const emailResult = await sendEmail(email, inviteLink);
    
    if (!emailResult.success) {
        // Fallback to other methods
        await copyToClipboard(inviteLink);
        // Could also integrate with Slack, Discord, etc.
    }
    
    return emailResult;
};
```

### 2. Add Email Status Tracking
```javascript
// Track delivery status
const trackEmailDelivery = {
    sent: new Date(),
    recipient: email,
    status: 'pending',
    emailService: 'EmailJS',
    template: 'team_invitation'
};
```

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- Always show the invitation link in the UI
- Provide multiple sharing options (email, copy link, QR code)
- Add email status indicators
- Implement retry mechanisms

## Quick Fix for Your Current Issue

1. **Immediate**: Ask users to check spam folders
2. **Today**: Upgrade your EmailJS template with the optimized content above
3. **This week**: Consider upgrading to EmailJS Pro plan
4. **Long term**: Implement a professional email service

## Testing Your Current Setup

1. Send an invitation to your own email
2. Check if it arrives (including spam folder)
3. Test with different email providers
4. Check the browser console for detailed logs
5. Verify the EmailJS dashboard shows successful sends

Remember: EmailJS "success" only means the email was accepted by their service, not that it was delivered to the inbox. Real delivery confirmation requires more advanced email services with delivery tracking.
