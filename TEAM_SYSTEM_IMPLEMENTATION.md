# Team Member System Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a team member system for InkCode that replaces the previous room-based collaboration with email invitations and team management.

## Key Features

### 1. Team-Based Projects
- Projects now have associated team members instead of just room IDs
- Each project maintains a list of team members with roles (owner, admin, member)
- Projects are shared across all team members automatically

### 2. Email Invitation System
- **Send Invitations**: Project owners and admins can invite team members by email
- **Invitation Links**: Secure invitation links are generated and copied to clipboard
- **Email Integration**: Links can be shared via email (currently manual, but ready for email service integration)
- **Expiration**: Invitations expire after 7 days for security

### 3. Team Management
- **Role Management**: Assign roles (owner, admin, member) to team members
- **Remove Members**: Owners and admins can remove team members
- **Member Overview**: View all team members with their photos, names, and roles
- **Pending Invitations**: Track and manage pending invitations

### 4. Dashboard Integration
- **Team Projects**: Dashboard shows all projects where user is a team member
- **Team Avatars**: Project cards display team member avatars
- **Team Manager**: Click team icon to manage team members
- **Project Ownership**: Clear indication of owned vs. member projects

### 5. Join Team Flow
- **Invitation Acceptance**: Users click invitation links to join teams
- **Email Verification**: System verifies user email matches invitation
- **Automatic Setup**: Projects automatically appear in user's dashboard after joining

## Implementation Details

### Database Structure
```
projects/
  {projectId}/
    name: "Project Name"
    language: "javascript"
    createdBy: "user-id"
    createdAt: timestamp
    roomId: "room-id"
    teamMembers/
      {userId}/
        userId: "user-id"
        name: "User Name"
        email: "user@example.com"
        photoURL: "photo-url"
        role: "owner" | "admin" | "member"
        joinedAt: timestamp
    invitations/
      {inviteId}/
        email: "invited@example.com"
        invitedBy: { user details }
        token: "invite-token"
        status: "pending"
        createdAt: timestamp
        expiresAt: timestamp

users/
  {userId}/
    projects/
      {projectId}/
        projectId: "project-id"
        joinedAt: timestamp
        role: "role"

invitations/
  {token}/
    // Global invitation lookup for easy access
```

### New Components

1. **TeamManager.jsx** - Modal for managing team members and invitations
2. **JoinTeam.jsx** - Page for accepting team invitations

### Updated Components

1. **Dashboard.jsx** - Now shows team-based projects with team management
2. **CodeEditor.jsx** - Updated to work with team members instead of room-based collaboration
3. **App.jsx** - Added route for team invitation acceptance

## Usage Flow

### For Project Owners:
1. Create a new project (automatically becomes team owner)
2. Click team management icon on project card
3. Enter email address to invite team members
4. Copy generated invitation link and send to team member
5. Manage team member roles and permissions

### For Invited Users:
1. Receive invitation link via email/message
2. Click link to open join team page
3. Sign in with correct email address
4. Accept invitation to join team
5. Project appears in dashboard automatically

### For Team Members:
1. View all team projects in dashboard
2. See team member avatars on project cards
3. Access team chat and collaboration features
4. View role-based permissions (owner/admin/member)

## Security Features

- **Email Verification**: Invitations are tied to specific email addresses
- **Token Expiration**: Invitation links expire after 7 days
- **Role-Based Access**: Different permissions for owners, admins, and members
- **Secure Links**: UUID-based invitation tokens prevent guessing

## Benefits

1. **No More Room IDs**: Users don't need to remember or share room IDs
2. **Email-Based Invitations**: Professional invitation system via email
3. **Persistent Team Access**: Team members can access projects anytime from dashboard
4. **Role Management**: Clear hierarchy and permissions
5. **Better Organization**: All team projects visible in one place
6. **Scalable**: Easy to add more team members as projects grow

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email Service Integration**: Automatically send invitation emails
2. **Team Notifications**: Real-time notifications for team activities
3. **Advanced Permissions**: Fine-grained permissions for different features
4. **Team Analytics**: Track team collaboration metrics
5. **Team Templates**: Save and reuse team configurations

The implementation maintains backward compatibility with existing room-based projects while providing a modern, scalable team collaboration system.
